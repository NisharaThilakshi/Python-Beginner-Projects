# Python-Beginner-Projects

Hey there! Here are some beginner projects for you to check out:


* First up is selector.py, which is a simple random selector that helps me choose who to FaceTime. It deals with imports and is really easy to use.

* Next, we have login.py, a fake login that lets you pretend you're hacking into a super secret mainframe (lol). It's a great way to practice if statements, imports, and print statements.

* Then there's madlibs.py, which is a blast to play with. You get to create silly stories and practice with inputs and strings.

* If you're into games, try out rock_paper_scissors.py. It's a classic and perfect for practicing functions and if statements.

* Lastly, there are two guess_the_number.py games - one for the computer and one for the user. Both of these games deal with random numbers, so they're a 
great way to practice with randomization.


Have fun!
